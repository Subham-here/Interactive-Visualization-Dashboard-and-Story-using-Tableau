## Project Overview

The dataset offers a granular view of real estate/property transaction records, which includes 18 columns, each representing various attributes related to the sale and characteristics of residential properties. This analysis aims to provide insights on the market trends, factors influencing desirability of the properties, correlation of price with various attributes or considering the potential for generating additional income through business activities.

## Result/Insights
1. M, RA, W are the areas where most of the properties have been sold. Property price rate is pretty high for few areas like E and AH but not a very significant sales figure came from those areas, where as half of the total sales came from only 2 areas. Maybe greater number of properties or having greater number of 2BHK properties which are driving the sales because of high demand.
2. Price rate of properties in the areas like E, AH is high and also having the high condo fees compared to others. Maybe because the area is kind of posh and nearby proper city. But average Tax paid for the area N is of a hefty amount considering the average price per squeare feet of the property there. Maybe highly regulated area or Government owned or maybe highly commercial purpose area for which a high amount of tax has to be paid
3. The offer which seller proposed had not stood still and most of the time they  had to sell the properties lower than that. That may happen because of the delay in closing a deal. Tax rate is increasing year on yar basis and the quoted price i.e the first price is not profitable for them becuase at a time a deal had been closing , tax rate alse had been increasing in the same period of time . So it has an effect on the price in which they had to sell the property.
